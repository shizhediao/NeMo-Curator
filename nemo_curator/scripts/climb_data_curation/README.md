# TODOs and Requirements

## TODO

1. **Step 5 is currently empty**  
   Implement the training process using **Nemo** or any other preferred framework.

2. **Improve compatibility between Step 4/6 and nemo-curator**  
   Steps 4 and 6 currently rely on custom code, which has poor compatibility with **nemo-curator**. This needs to be optimized.

## Requirements

- `seaborn`
- `lightgbm`
